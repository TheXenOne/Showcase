# Showcase

This repository is intended to show some of the code I have created in the past 3 years.

It is not provided in a state where it will run, as most of it is pulled from larger projects, however it should demonstrate some of my ability and what I have learned.

Code is divided by language and then project.

Code from 2D Engine uses Doxygen comment style.
